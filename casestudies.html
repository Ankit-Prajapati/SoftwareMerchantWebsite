                                        <p>Software Merchant Inc. developed the Macys Mobile App which is the easiest way to
                                            save time and money on the go. Macys iPhone app is the ultimate holiday shopping
                                            buddy! The Challenge - Macys, although extremely popular for its huge client
                                            base, didn't have anything to rely on to meet the needs of all their customers
                                            exactly where they are! In this increasingly competitive mobile world of merchandizing,
                                            the management saw how it's important to convert all their mobile customers into
                                            serious revenue. For this, they wanted to build an industry-leading mobile app
                                            to drive engagement and make it possible for their customers to stay in loop
                                            at the tip of their fingers. The Solution - The expert mobile developers of Software
                                            Merchant Inc built the entire mobile app enabling users to browse the entire
                                            site anytime, anywhere with features that allowed potential customers to use
                                            the store locator to check their local Macys store hours other events. The users
                                            had access to special offers & in-store savings, registry, finding gifts for
                                            others, managing the personal account and also using the smart scan feature to
                                            get instant access to product details, prices, reviews & more.

                                        <p>Software Merchant Inc. developed an App for NYC Department of Education called PSAL.
                                            The PSAL-NYC iOS app allows parents and students to enjoy a more user friendly
                                            app featuring high school sports, featuring: scores, stats, standings and more!
                                            About PSAL The mission of the Public Schools Athletic League is to provide opportunities
                                            to educate students in physical fitness, character development and socialization
                                            skills through an athletic program that fosters teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship.
                                            Established in 1903, the PSAL is the longest running scholastic athletic program
                                            in the country. The Challenge The management team of NYC Department of Education
                                            needed to change the requirements for the App features multiple times during
                                            the process of development. This caused the team of iOS developers to discuss
                                            if any discrepancies arose during the development and let the management know
                                            the same. The Solution Software Merchant Inc developed the entire app sooner
                                            than the stipulated time frame by successfully adding all the features needed
                                            in the app. Several discussions were held wherein the developers gave their views
                                            on the changes proposed by the management and accommodated all aspects desired
                                            in the app. The iOS developers fixed production issues, enhanced the architecture
                                            and flow of the app, further enhanced the user interface and deployed the app
                                            in the App store, followed by testing.

                                        <p>Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization, the oldest of
                                            the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A
                                            total of 30 teams now play in the American League (AL) and National League (NL),
                                            with 15 teams in each league. The Challenge - The management of Major League
                                            Baseball (MLB) had a new project to be completed among many other ongoing projects
                                            for their mlb.com website and another website called mlb.tv. They needed a new
                                            team to manage the EBIS2 application which is where Software Merchant Inc stepped

                                        <p>Software Merchant Inc. developed the Costco Mobile App which is the easiest way to
                                            save time and money on the go. The Challenge - To get rid of the old database
                                            was to be shut down, so that there is no redundant data. The cognos reports pointed
                                            at data from the old database, which needed to be replaced with oracle. It was
                                            imperative to redesign the system to point towards the new database so that Costco's
                                            data is secured and reliable. The Solution - Software Merchant Inc considered
                                            the amalgamation of 5 developers, a technical lead, a project manager and 3 Quality
                                            Analysts to execute the project. In order to get rid of the old database, the
                                            team worked on replacing it with Oracle so that the cognos reports point to Oracle
                                            instead, thereby ensuring that there is no duplication of data anywhere.

                                            is to serve as a vehicle for educators and administrators to view and record

                                            management needed a tool which they could use as they went to attend a class

                                            It would be difficult to go to several classrooms every day with a bulky computer
                                            or several sheets of paper. This situation demanded the use of some technology,
                                            perhaps with the use of an iPad, which is regarded as convenient to carry around

                                            of Transportation is in charge of all transportation issues for the state of
                                            Pennsylvania. Driver and Vehicle services, Emissions, are some of the main services
                                            which come under PennDOT's umbrella. PennDOT are all about efficiency and each
                                            employee is expected to have a mobile device with the capability of exchanging
                                            real time information. The company was in need of a tool which would act as a
                                            connection between your office and your mobile device. At the same time, accessing
                                            corporate resources from a mobile device can introduce a significant threat to
                                            corporate security. Considering all security issues, PennDOT decided to implement
                                            a tool called AirWatch. The Challenge Three years ago, PennDOT decided to implement
                                            mobile app technology as they wanted to communicate with their employees at remote
                                            sites by pushing data onto their phones in real time. Once they implemented mobile
                                            technology, the next concern was security of sensitive information. PennDOT was
                                            not sure how they could manage all this information in a safe manner when BYOD
                                            (Bring your own device) had become so popular. The concern of losing data due
                                            to lost phones or reset passwords was always lingering.

                                            Commonwealth of Pennsylvania The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the government

                                            company Enterprise data on the iPad and iPhone platform. One of the big challenges
                                            they faced during this process was security of their data. The Challenge Security
                                            in mobile devices has become the need of the hour. The whole umbrella of the
                                            Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was in need of a secure data encryption service,
                                            primarily for sensitive company data like company emails and other remote communication.
                                            This was during a period of transformation from Blackberry to iPhones or Androids
                                            and this posed a new challenge of needing a service with consistent user interface
                                            for all the different mobile platforms. This era of BYOD (Bring your own device)
                                            demanded the use of some cutting edge technology for securing company information.

                                        <p>PennDot using Software Merchant's Mobile Driver's License Application app to reduce
                                            the long waits at the Office PennDot The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
                                            is in charge of all transportation issues for the state of Pennsylvania. Driver
                                            and Vehicle services, Emissions, are some of the main services which come under
                                            PennDot's umbrella. PennDot has an online portal for Driver licenses and the
                                            services associated with it. Using this, one can schedule driving license test
                                            and update changes to one's profile (Exhibit 1). The Challenge Though the potential
                                            drivers test taker is able to schedule his or her driver's test online, the use
                                            of technology ends there. What would it be like to have an integrated platform
                                            to input all the data from the actual driving test, into a system, as and when
                                            the test is taken? The one potential challenge with approach would be that a
                                            laptop cannot be carried around during a driving test. The best solution for
                                            this would involve using tablets or mobile phone devices to carry around and
                                            have an application which allows the examiner to input data on the driver taking
                                            the test, as and when the test is being conducted.

                                            sales representatives in stores were using computers to manage their enterprise
                                            data. They were also acting as customer service representatives, which involved
                                            moving around the store, to show the customers the various items on display.
                                            This led to a requirement to have something mobile which they could carry with
                                            them, to enter data or record sales, while showing the customers the different
                                            products in the store. The representatives wanted an integrated platform to access

                                            telecommunications corporation, providing wireless data and voice services. AT&T
                                            is the largest provider of mobile networks in the USA and is headquartered at
                                            Dallas, Texas. AT&T has been a pioneer in network quality is are widely regarded
                                            as the provider with the best wireless network. One of AT&T's new initiatives
                                            is to track objects known as bots, which identify network failures and drops
                                            due to congestion in large spaces like stadiums. The Challenge AT&T have placed
                                            several bots in many stadiums, to track the performance of the AT&T network,
                                            to check for dropped calls or lost network for voice and data. They had many
                                            people stationed in the stadiums, to physically locate each of these bots when
                                            they needed to be monitored for a battery change or other maintenance. There
                                            were many instances when the people stationed were not able to locate these bots,
                                            leading to several dysfunctional bots. AT&T were in need of a technology used
                                            to locate these bots remotely to help enable easy tracking and identification.
